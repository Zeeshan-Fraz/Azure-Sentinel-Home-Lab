<h1>Azure Sentinel SIEM Honeypot Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
The purpose of this project is to create a honey pot virtual machine with an open port connection, to allow threat actors to try and RDP connect to the machine, whilst being able to capture sign in logs using a custom created powershell script. And to plot the geogrphical data onto a world map.
<br />

<h2>Objectives</h2>

I used a customer powershell script to extract metadata from windows event viewer, which was forwarded to a third party API in order to derive geolocation data

I configured Log analytics workspace in Azure to ingest custom logs containing geographic information (latitude, longitude, state/province and country)

I configured a workspace with the intent of mapping geo data in Azure Sentinel

I configured azure Sentinel (Microsoftâ€™s SIEM) workbook to display global attack data (RDP brute force) on world map according to physical location and magnitude of attacks.

You may be asking why should I create a resource group first and why not the virtual machine right away.
This is because in Azure we will be creating a lot of resources and from my experience it is easier to setup a new resource group as this will make it a lot easier later in this lab.

To create a new resource group, click on the resource groups button

Click on the resource group button to create your resource group

By default, there will be no resource groups and we will have to create one for this lab.

<br />

Click on the create resource group button and you will be presented with the project details and resource details field that need to be filled in.
NOTE: the default subscription will always be Azure subscription 1 with the free Azure sign up

<br /> 

As I will be using my virtual machine for a honeypot scenario, I have called mine Honeypot-Lab, but you can name your resource group to any name as you wish. anything of your choice.

<br /> 

NOTE: in the region settings, by default it will be set to (US) EAST US, this is the region where we want to deploy our resource group to a region where the data centre is situated. I set mine to (Europe) UK South as this was the recommended option for myself for the region, I am in.
Then click the review + create button and your new resource group should be created:
